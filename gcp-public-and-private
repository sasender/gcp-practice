create a vpc with 2 subnets, in gcp vpc has global level unlike aws vpc, create the vpc subnets and mention cidr/ ranges those subnets ,and create firewall group and for vpc and mentiosn or segrigate network traffic by using tags 
after creating vpcs and subnets, need to launch the two vms ( one is with external ip/ another one in is only internall ip) and check the connectiviy for public ip , whoch connecting to the internaet without interptions but when commes to the private ip instances there is no connectivyt has been esablished 
so we need to additnala setup do for establishin the connctions, 
a) need to enable the  Identity-Aware Proxy in gcp , IAP TCP forwarding allows you to establish an encrypted tunnel over which you can forward SSH, RDP, and other traffic to VM instances.
source ip range is Including 35.235.240.0/20 in the source ranges allows SSH connections using Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) TCP forwarding if all other prerequisites are met


c) creat a firewall for iap-tcp 

give the ipv4 address- 35.235.240.0/20

d) create cloud nat-gateway:
      cloud nat lets connecting our resources communication to with each other by using shraing . publci ip 

      cloud nat is region specific, not for the global specific like ( vpc)
      create the cloud router ( for cloud nat gatewa)

e) try to ping to the vm for netwrok connections
